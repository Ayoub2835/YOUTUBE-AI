"""Snapchat publisher.

IMPORTANT LIMITATION: unlike YouTube and TikTok, Snapchat does not currently
offer a public server-side API for organic creators to publish directly to
Spotlight. Snapchat's official APIs are either:

- The Marketing API (`https://marketingapi.snapchat.com`), which publishes
  paid ads, not organic Spotlight posts.
- Creative Kit, a client-side SDK that opens Snapchat's own app with your
  media pre-attached so a *human* taps "send" -- it cannot post
  unattended from a server.

This publisher therefore does not perform an unattended upload. It
validates that credentials/config are present for future use, and exposes
``prepare_manual_package`` so the pipeline can hand off a ready-to-post
folder (video + thumbnail + caption) for a human to publish through the
Snapchat app, while keeping the same interface as the other publishers so
this can be swapped for a real API call the moment Snapchat exposes one.
